# Zirkonium3 Release Notes

This is an overview of important info and changes between versions.

3.7.0: 2021 Jun 12
------------------

### Fixed

* fixed crash due to triple-tap look up gesture handling on buttons & sliders
* fixed crash due to OSC sender socket creation failure when opening Zirkonium
  on some systems while WiFi is off (reported by Anton Nikkil√§)
* fixed crash at bounce end when recording OSC (reported by Lise-Lotte Norelius)

* fixed regression where speaker level reporting was causing document edit,
  this would happen during playback when speaker level reporting is on although
  no saveable data is changed, issue introduced by 3.6.2 speaker level OSC fix

* fixed HRTF activating for IDs with algorithm set to OSC or None, now correctly
  handles changing ID algorithm while HRTF is on

* fixed dome view bug where moving curve handle would move anchor point instead
* fixed dome view cursor flicker on hover during playback

* fixed motion view not allowing min or max vertical values when dragging
* fixed motion view vertical scale view not always showing current event anchors
* fixed motion view paths not drawn for new event until mouse interaction
  (reported by Ben Miller)

* fixed event view thumbnails rendering dark on macOS 11
* fixed event view shortening event duration when dragging start < 0
* fixed event view showing resize handles in pen or affine transform mode
* fixed event view pen mode drag rectangle not staying on mouse click ID track
* fixed preferences and settings text entries triggering arrow key hotkeys and
  hogging focus from main window after done editing
* fixed nudge hotkeys moving event times to < 0 & moving initial event times
* fixed some time text entries not showing last digit when editing
* fixed go to beginning not always setting time to 0
* fixed loop button not using system tint color when enabled

* fixed not using detected string key when loading paths from pre-3.4 projects,
  which could result in empty paths
* fixed incorrect range when getting motion path values at phase 1 (end)

### Added

* added support for Apple arm64 with universal build
* added macOS dark appearance mode support

* added event gain path with dB -100 - +6 range (0 is original gain)
* added new edit & usability features:
  - dome view: add a point to nearest curve on existing path with double-click
  - dome view: double-click on anchor point to expand/contract handles
  - dome view: double-click on handle to contract to the anchor point
  - dome view: added right-click Transform Path popover
  - dome view: transform actions can now be done to multiple selected events
  - dome view: transform tool resizes with aspect ratio from corner
  - motion view: added right-click to Add/Edit Point popover
  - motion view: added right-click to Straighten Path
  - motion view: double-click on anchor point to straighten next curve
  - event view: drag select to select multiple events
  - event view: move, resize, & delete now applied to all selected events
  - event view: click & drag with mouse wheel or middle button to look around

* added dome view sound path option to draw muted events in gray, this should
  make it easier to understand why no sound is playing (requested by Ben Miller)
* added dome view right-click to Close Path, this adds a new end point over the
  start point if start & end are not already together (requested by Ben Miller) 

* added motion view right-click Snap to Prev for first span or gain point,
  depending on the current motion view mode
* motion view now draws dotted gain path in background
* added motion view span % & gain dB scales

  mirror the event view slider directions (requested by Sebastian Schottke)
* added event view opt-click on event to set time to event start
* added event start/end time order dialog with options to move or swap, this
  replaces the "Start must be before end" error after manual time entry
* added event view Escape key handling to cancel current mouse drag action
* event view ID list header now accepts vertical scroll events

* added OSC ID polar azimuth/elevation position sending option, this should make
  it easier to control systems like Panoramix, etc (requested by Ben Miller)
* added OSC ID gain rms & dB sending options (requested by Ben Miller)
* added OSC ID gain & dB receiving via /gain/rms & /gain/db
* added OSC ID & Group polar pos recording 
* Network Preferences:
  - added Update Senders button for recreating OSC sender sockets
  - added OSC sender table red highlight for failed senders

    address is invalid

* added sources table right-click Show in Finder menu item

### Updated

* minimum OS version now macOS 10.12
* Pure Data externals now built from source (assisted by Chikashi Miyama)
* tweaked UI for macOS 11

* updated all UI icons for better readability and high-resolution scaling

* updated JACK support to newer JACK2 lib, replaces old 32-bit JackOSX framework
  (now use the macOS installer from https://jackaudio.org/downloads)

* ID track mute & solo now saved with project (requested by Sebastian Schottke)
* ID track mute and solo button handling improved to match expected DAW behavior
  (requested by Sebastian Schottke), in this case modeled on Apple Logic Pro X:
  - muted buttons for manually muted tracks draw in blue (as before)
  - mute buttons for tracks muted by soloed IDs now drawn in teal (light blue)
  - manually muted tracks stay muted unless the ID solo is enabled
  - solo muted tracks are unmuted when last ID solo is disabled
  - manual mute is reapplied when track solo is disabled

* sources table source, gain, & location columns can now resize wider
* sources table location column now truncates head to show trailing folders
* updated Group removal dialog so second button is cancel to follow Apple HIG

  only has 1 point (reported by Ben Miller)
* motion view right-click Add/Edit Point popover now uses span % range 0 - 100

* events now clip instead of showing overlap error after editing times in event
  view table, this matches event view resize behavior (suggested by Ben Miller)
* event view click to set time now consistent across all editor modes

* smooth inconsistent dB values in UI by rounding to integers
* time text entries now support simple second values > 60 for 00 or 00.00
  time string formats, ie. 90 -> 01:30 (requested by Ben Miller)

* default project OSC address patterns changed to match receiver patterns:
  - /zirk/id/@{id}/position -> /pan/xy
  - /zirk/id/@{id}/span -> /span
  - /zirk/time -> /time
  note: this does not affect existing projects
* OSC level message addresses changed to better match receiver patterns:
  - /zirk/level/id -> /level/id
  - /zirk/level/speaker -> /level/speaker
  warning: custom software receiving these messages will need to be updated
* moved ZirkPad sync from Project Settings -> Network tab to Sync tab
* OSC /solo message now requires an additional float state argument 0 or 1
* OSC Sender preferences now accepts IPv6 addresses/hostnames (ie. "localhost")

* replaced stub help menu item with Help -> Zirkonium3 Manual item, this will
  try to open the included Manual.pdf if it's found next to the .app
